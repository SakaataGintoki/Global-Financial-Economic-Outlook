1. Global GDP ($117.49T) is only slightly higher than global debt ($106.85T), indicating high leverage at the global level and limited fiscal buffer for many economies.

2. The United States and China dominate global GDP, together accounting for a large concentration of world economic output, while the gap between them and other countries is significant.

3. Gold reserves are heavily concentrated in a few countries, led by the United States, Germany, and France, highlighting their stronger long-term monetary security.
